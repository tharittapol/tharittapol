## Hi there 👋
I’m **Big Tharittapol** — a **Robotics & Automation Engineer**

### 🚀 What I’m working on
- **🚗 Service robots — Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs):** building end‑to‑end systems from sensing & perception to navigation, control, and deployment; validated in real‑world integrations
- **🏭 Industrial automation (SI):** ABB robot simulation & programming (RobotStudio, RAPID); PLC ladder & HMI (Mitsubishi, Omron, Siemens); OPC UA integration
- **🧪 Education:** beginner robotics teaching, workshops, and training camps 
  
> If any of these match your interests, 👯 let’s collaborate! PRs and issues are welcome ✅

### 🌱 What I'm Learning
I’m following a structured path: first revisiting core AI and math fundamentals; next the NVIDIA AI stack (CUDA, TensorRT, DeepStream); and finally applying AI to robotics with ROS 2, Isaac Sim, and Isaac ROS for sim‑to‑real workflows
